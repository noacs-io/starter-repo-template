# Associations between emergency procedures and outcomes in adult trauma patients

This repository includes the manuscript and code for the research project on associations between emergency procedures and outcomes in adult trauma patients. 

## Summary

### Introduction
Trauma, the clinical entity composed of physical injury and the bodyâ€™s associated response, is a
massive global health threat. Reducing mortality and morbidity from trauma is part of the
Sustainable Development Goals and improving trauma care is crucial to realize these goals.
Trauma care is time sensitive and early interventions are key to save lives and limit suffering. The
WHO has identified a set of procedures that should be performed early during trauma patient
management, drawing from established trauma life support guidelines. It remains unknown to
what extent these procedures are practiced, and how they associate with patient outcomes.

### Aim
To assess how emergency procedures associate with outcomes in adult trauma patients

### Methods
This will be a secondary analysis of data from an interrupted time series study and pilot cluster
randomized controlled trial in hospitals across urban India. The participants are adult trauma
patients. The sample size will be approximately 3000 patients. The student will conduct both
unadjusted analyses and analyses adjusted for age, sex, mechanism of injury and trauma severity.
Dichotomous outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression and continuous outcomes will
be analysed using linear regression. A subgroup analysis of patients arriving within 48 hours of
injury will be performed. All analyses will use a 5% significance level and 95% confidence level.
